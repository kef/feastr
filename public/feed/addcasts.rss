			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David breaks into Agile 2011 and we manage to record a show with Michael Feathers – Chief Scientist @ Obtiva, “Working Effectively with Legacy Code” author, and just a guy who thought he was going to write a book so people would solve the problems themselves. Instead they all wanted him to work for them.</p>
<p>Michael talks to us about refactoring in the fourth dimension and scaling humans, a few topics that have been on his mind at Agile 2011. He wants to know what we can learn about how software teams work and how a code base got to be a certain way by analzying version control history. </p>
<p>What are the universal truths of software development? There may not be many, but Dave explains why you should never buy software written on a Thursday.</p>
<p>Assorted topics for your ADDed pleasure:</p>
<ul>
<li>economics vs emotions in your choice of technical practices</li>
<li>how monkey-patching freezes a software system in time</li>
<li>the code ecosystem</li>
<li>seducing end-users!</li>
<li>when you just need to take the code out back and shoot it</li>
<li>what has and hasn’t changed in software in the past decade</li>
</ul>
<p>Michael is currently working on a new book called “Brutal Refactoring,” and has published a few articles that we talked about in this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://drdobbs.com/article/print?articleId=231002664&amp;siteSectionName=">Discovering hidden design</a></li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BACK ONCE AGAIN WITH THE ILL BEHAVIOR!!!</p>
<p>Pat and Dave have been heads-down on a critical project and you know what? You don&#8217;t want to hear our excuse. We don&#8217;t have one. We&#8217;re sorry. And WE&#8217;RE BACK.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s hour-long episode, Dave lets Pat talk for nearly nine minutes&mdash;don&#8217;t worry, he doesn&#8217;t let him do it all at once&mdash;starting with catching up socially and then moving on to dealing with legacy data, data migrations, and the difference between using a Document-Oriented Database and simply using a Document-Oriented Strategy. Today we talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>0:00: Best Opening Credits Ever</li>
<li>1:12: On the passing of Steve Jobs, Dennis Ritchie and John McCarthy&mdash;why Dave was more upset about Dennis Ritchie than Steve Jobs, and why we grieve for celebrities. (EDIT: My apologies, I failed to give credit to <a href="http://twitter.com/tehviking">Brandon Hays (@tehviking)</a> for the &#8220;celebrity investiture&#8221; idea. &mdash;Dave)</li>
<li>9:15: Getting out of debt</li>
<li>11:30: Postcards from the Edge of the adoption process in America&mdash;and we mean &#8220;Adoption&#8221; adoption, as in the process of assuming the legal guardianship of a human being</li>
<li>15:00: Legacy Databases: if your legacy data is completely messed up, consider looking at (and helping out with) <a href="http://github.com/dbrady/migratrix">Migratrix</a></li>
<li>28:00: Agile database refactoring and testing</li>
<li>41:20: NoSQL in SQL: Using a Document-oriented <i>strategy</i> in a SQL database</li>
<li>45:00: Why you should check out <a href="http://github.com/jamesgolick/friendly">Friendly ORM</a></li>
<li>56:45: Hermeneutics Loves Documents, Formalism Loves SQL</li>
<li>1:02:50: Sneak Peek at Upcoming Episodes&mdash;<a href="http://twitter.com/mfeathers">Michael Feathers</a>, we owe you a HUGE apology for taking so long getting your interview up. It&#8217;s NEXT!</li>
</ul>
<p>A Note on Call Quality: Pat and I take redundant steps to make sure the call quality stays high. Unfortunately in this call we experienced redundant failures. Pat&#8217;s side didn&#8217;t record at all, so we had to rely on my recording, and halfway through the call Skype throttled the bandwidth so hard that Pat sort of becomes an impressionist painting with garbled audio. We apologize for the inconvenience and are looking into new recording solutions to avoid this in the future.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Evan Light joins us in the 11th episode of ADDcasts. We kick off the show with a discussion about TDD, where Evan tells us that TDD is more than about testing, code quality, and design. He shares some tips on how to use TDD for requirements gathering and analysis. Then, Evan being the freelancing conversation magnet that he is, we turn to the question of how to make sure you get paid for the work that you do. Along the way, Dave rewrites Pat’s lame joke, Evan makes hilarious faces, and we peer into the minds of cats and dogs.</p>

<li>Dave boldly stated: &#8220;C++ is the best object-oriented programming language ever, given its philosophy.&#8221; A minute later he was explaining how folks with ADD have hunting instincts in a world dominated by farming behavior. He cites <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Attention-Deficit-Disorder-Different-Perception/dp/1887424148/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1306880472&#038;sr=1-1'>ADD: A Different Perception</a> as a useful resource for understanding ADD.

(25:21)</li>
<li>We pontificate about how Erlang&#8217;s messaging patterns are OOish in nature. Pat brings up <a href='http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html'>Alan Kay&#8217;s mailing list post stating &#8220;the big idea is messaging.&#8221;</a> (32:00)</li>
<li><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Streamlined-Object-Modeling-Patterns-Implementation/dp/0130668397'>Streamlined Object Modeling</a> &#8211; Pat cites this book as a good reference for collaboration patterns, and how it demonstrates the &#8220;flipped&#8221; nature of object-oriented design. (53:30)</a>
<li>Dave wonders whether <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1306881044&#038;sr=1-1'>Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns</a> it&#8217;s relevant today. Pat thinks it provides a straightforward, systematic approach to crafting code. (1:01:00)</li>

(Caveat: we don&#8217;t really talk about the rapture that much. Or at all, really. Except for at the end.) We talk about aliens (the extraterrestrial kind), NASA&#8217;s Gravity Probe B mission, Pat&#8217;s work with payment gateways, tips and tricks for diving into legacy codebases, working for abusive bosses (both con and pro, and Pat and Dave both share experiences where they WERE the abusive boss), communication breakdowns and using Pair Programming as the solution, the value of Metaphor in communication, Dave&#8217;s (in)famous &#8220;Italian Nachos&#8221; metaphor&#8230; and the madness to his method of using it.</p>
<p>Show Notes and obligatory fact checking:</p>
<p>Dave mentions the Andromeda Galaxy and the M-31 Galaxy in the same sentence. They&#8217;re the same galaxy.</p>
<p>The NASA experiment Dave mentions at 6:10 is the &#8220;Gravity Probe B&#8221; experiment. NASA&#8217;s experiment announcement is here: <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/04may_epic/">http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/04may_epic/</a>. Dave mentions at 7:50 that some of the distortion may be due to fluctuations in the Earth&#8217;s surface gravity, but this was just made up in his head. Not actual science!</p>
<p>Pat swears at 28:14, but our censors caught it.</p>
<p>Dave mentions a story about Steve Jobs and Apple in the New York Times at 52:10. This story actually appeared in Wired: <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/05/steve-jobs-magic/ ">http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/05/steve-jobs-magic/</a> Dave seriously sucks at details, huh?</p>
